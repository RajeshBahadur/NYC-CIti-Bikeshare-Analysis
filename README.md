  # Looking at the image , it appears that male riders uses more bike than female riders.
  # Result of the analysis
    # The analsysis of data from NYC CitiBike share dats shows that, the age of the population is important as people in there late 40's and early 50's are the maximum         user of the Bike and within that categories, male poulation are using most of the bike. We need to look into poulation data of Des Moines to check which age             categories are more in the city. 
    # Also, we need to check for Des Monies which station will have the highest checkout point condisering popularity of that station.
    # After finding the popular station, we should plan for the inventories of bike to be kept in that location to generate maximum trip.
    
    # Summary
      # The data avaibale from NYC Bikeshare is a good starting point to understand users profile and uses of bike during the weekdays. For considering investment in           Des Moines, we need information on dempgrapic of the population, traffic situation in the city and the number of tourist visting the city.
      # An additional analsysis can be done to check on the repeat riders i.e to check how many riders are using the bike over and over again and design the special            pricing for such repeat customers.
